## 🎯 Project Overview

This project applies binary classification to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The dataset contains 7,043 customers with features covering demographics, account information, subscribed services and billing details.

The analysis covers:
- Exploratory data analysis of churn patterns
- Data cleaning, feature engineering and scaling
- Model training — Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- Model comparison using accuracy and 5-fold cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis to identify key churn drivers

---

## 📊 Key Questions Answered

- What is the overall churn rate?
- How does contract type affect churn?
- Do monthly charges and tenure influence churn behaviour?
- Which model best predicts customer churn?
- What are the most important features in predicting churn?

## 🚀 How to Run

**1. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Download the dataset:**

Get the CSV from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and place it inside the `data/` folder.

**3. Run the notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

Run all cells top to bottom. Charts will be saved automatically to `outputs/`.

## 💡 Key Findings

- Overall churn rate is approximately 26% across all customers
- **Month-to-month contracts** have a significantly higher churn rate than one or two-year contracts
- **Fibre optic** internet service customers churn at a higher rate than DSL customers
- Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn
- **Tenure**, **monthly charges** and **contract type** are the top predictors of churn
